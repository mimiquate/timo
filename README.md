# Introduction
Timo is an app that let you see differents timezones at the same time. This is really useful
to organize meetings with people from differents timezones.

# Usage
After creating account in Timo, you will be able to
create multiple teams and add members to each one with their timezone.

This will create a table, showing your current time, and showing what time is in
each member location.

Also, you can generate a link to let others see your calendar, even if they don't have account in Timo.

Clicking in any row will redirect to your Google Calendar in order to create
an event using the selected time.
